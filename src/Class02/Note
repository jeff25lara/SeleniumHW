How many locators do we have in Selenium?

8 locators
    1.ID
    2.Name
    3.Class
    4.LinkText-->they can only be used with a link and must have text (must have and <a>  </a> tag)
    5.Xpath
    6.Css
    7.TagName---> just specify the tag that you want to find multiple web elements
    8.Partial Linktext--->they can only be used with a link

Why do we have multiple locators?
    sometimes there might be a locator with duplicate value
        <input id"email",name=a


     ometimes the developers might not provide you with all the locators

There are some important things that you should remember while selecting locators
    if a attribute value has a number in it, it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator!

Difference between linkText and partialLinkText
    a partial link text can use just a part of the link text


    ---------------
    what did we learn today

locators-
    in selenium help us find the web elements
    8 locators
    id, name, className
    linkText, partialLinkText (only be used for <a> and it must have some text)
    TagName- we just need to pass the tagName and it is going to find that particular webElement
DOM- Document Object Model
    here we have the whole code for the website
       example- if there are two elements with the same attribute value what will happen?
            Selenium is going to get the first one it encounters.
