1-Relative Xpath
    syntax for xpath



    <input name="abra",class="fhdhfd"/>

    //input[@name="abra"



    b- syntax
    translation:
        hey, get me the tagname which has a text "text value"

    condition-
        our html code (webelement) must have text.

     Example
        <button id="tro",class="fyo"> heelo</button>
   Answer-
        //button[text()='hello']


   c- Syntax for xpath (finding by certain method)

        a. for attribute
        //tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
        translation-`
            get me the tag name which has an attribute whose value contains "partial value of the attribute"

            EXAMPLE
   <input email="how are you i am fine, thank you" id="dsfs"/>
   xpath using contains method:
        //input[contains(gmail,'how are you')]

   c-b for text
   //tagname[contains(text(), 'partial attribute value')]

   contains- can be used in a scenario where
   1-the attribute or text is very long
   2- when part of the value or text is dynamic

   <button id='hello 0'/>   -----> wont always work
    //button[contains


in xpath we learn 4types
-by attribute




you tried alot but still you were unable to find the unique xpath or locator for a WebElement
it alwasy shows 1 of 2
which one will be accessed when you use
driver.findElement?
    answer- first one that is encountered


Scenerio
    if you are unable to find a uniuqe and it always showes 1 or 2 or 1 of 4 you can
    use indexing but make sure it is last resort as any additional changes in code might
    affect indexing

    Syntax ---> //tagname[@attribute value"] [index] ---> index stats from 1 here not 0



Absolute xpath

absolute xpath refers to the exact pin point of the locations of the element
but it is usually avoided, not much used in the industry
as a little change in dom can change that location.

<html>
<head>
    <title> myWebPage </title>
</head>
<body>
            <input id='email'/>
            <button x="a"> hello<a/>
    </body>

</html>



----------------By TagName---------------
in order to use this locator you just give the tagName
it is very helpful in scenarios where you want to get multiple elements with the same tag name





--------------revise-------------------

1-Xpath

    a-Relative
        1.attribute //taNname[@attribute = 'attribute value']
        2.by text //tagName[text()='text value']
        3.by partial value //tagName[contains@attribute,'partial attribute value']
        4.by partial text value //tagName[contains(text(), 'partial text value')]

    Absolute

        1-clean() ---> it deletes the text in the text box
        2-getText() ----> gets the text if there is any


        the locator tagName;
        -   we use this usually when we need to access multiple elements with same tagName

        getAttribute()---> to get the value of an attribute from the webElement
